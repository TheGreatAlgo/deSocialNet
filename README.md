Censorship Free and Immutable


In the spirit of decentralization I have made hosting this extremely easy. Just download the homepage.html and host it whatever way you prefer so that it is accessible via localhost:xxxx


Once that is completed, you will have full functionality of the website. 

All of the assets are hosted via IPFS or built into the html.
