# deSocialNet
Censorship Free and Immutable

https://desocialnet.com

In the spirit of decentralization I have made hosting this extremely easy. Just download the homepage.html and host it whatever way you prefer so that it is accessible via localhost:xxxx


Once that is completed, you will have full functionality of deSocialNet. 

Do the same for breakin.html for full functionality of the Breakin game.

All of the assets are hosted via IPFS or built into the html.
